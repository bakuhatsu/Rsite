Now it's time to actually start coding!  Open up RStudio and follow along below.  We'll do an example project using real data from The National Center for Enviromental Information.

## Analyzing tempurature and precipitation ##

Ok, I know you have been anxious to get to this point.  

1. Import data, format data, summarize data, plot data.
2. Make this into a function to use on similar datasets
3. Use `manipulate` package to make this function interactive.
4. Test this with other similar datasets.

Required R file: [summary.SE](/Rsite/files/summarySE.R)

Data is from: ([http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search))
